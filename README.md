# Mafia Discord Rich Presence

A plugin for original Mafia Game which purposed to demonstrate your game state in Discord.

## What is Discord Rich Presence?

## What can it do?
For the current version it shows a game mission you play and supportes these states:
* "Loading Game..."
* "Loading Mission..."
* "Watching a Cutscene..."
* "Driving a Car..."
* "On a Train..."

## Usage:
1. First of all you should install the [UltimateASILoader by ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader).
2. Create "scripts" folder in your game folder.
3. Put .ASI file from releases to the "scripts" folder.
4. Launch Discord and run the game.
5. Enjoy.

## Supported Mafia versions:
At the moment the script supportes Mafia v1.2 (Steam, GOG).
